	<p><h2>My mothertongue is tamil. Tamil is a part of the Dravidian family. Tamil is mostly spoken in the state of Tamil Nadu in India.Other than Tamil Nadu, tamil is a recognized official language in Puducherry a Union Territory in India,Singapore and Sri Lanka.It is an recognized minority language in Malaysia,Mauritius and South Africa. Tamil speakers are everywhere even in Pakistan. Tamil is very under recognized by many because most assume that India is just a hindi speaking country but India has so many languages that it's uncountable by that I mean unofficial languages definitely the most in the world. Tamil is believed by many,including me,to be the oldest language.This is so since root words of tamil are found in about 400 languages across the world. Tamil has 247 letters.You must be puzzled at that number so to break it down it is 12 vowels and 18 consonants.These form 216 compound characters and then there is one unique character called the "aaytha ezhuthu." So it is 12+18+216+1 which equals 247. Tamil is the only language that is also worshipped as god.The language has an alphabet that is so unique that no country has it it is "zh" which makes sort of a "la" sound.Tamil is also the first language in India to be printed and published with the help of the Portugese because they ruled part of India at that time.In the whole world there is about 70 million tamil speakers.Tamil spread to many countries because of dynasties such as the biggest the Chola,Chera and Pandya Dynasty.It was also the only language to have a whole community ruled by kings.Tamil is about the 19th most spoken language in the world.In India itself it is in the 5th spot.There was someone called Thiruvalluvar who wrote 1,330 couplets about the moralities of life.This is followed by many people and being passed on known as a part of the culture.Tamil is truly amazing and very undernoticed for how it's contributed in infinite ways.I hope one day tamil can be noticed for its great doings. </h2>
