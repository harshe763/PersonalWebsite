<body><p> I love traveling.Traveling is amazing seeing the views and just chilling.In the beginning I hated the long car drives but as the years went on it improved my patience now I feel like Mahatma Gandhi.But I prefer plane rides over car rides. My vision on traveling is different than others.For me traveling inludes like others traveling as well like airports,actually traveling and geography because it sort of involves traveling so India is on the otherside of the map and I'm like oh in total it takes about 15 hours. I like flights and airports like they just attract my interest and my eyes. If I go to a airport to pick up a visitor I would be happier than they are just to see the airport.So far my favorite destinations have been Los Angeles,Miami,Seattle,Vancouver and the whole of Tamil Nadu.So my explanation is LA because my cousins live there and the weather is so hot and it feel like NYC but just hotter.Miami because my favorite basketball team is there and it is hot and because of Miami Beach.Seattle was so large and the streets were spot clean. Vancouver made me feel different it was so beautiful and clean but the only thing I didn't like about it was it was freezing and it was summer.I like Tamil Nadu because I like to see my relatives,the busy markets and just the beautiful street life,the free cows walking,all the movie posters,beautiful fields and lakes its just a different feeling I get good vibes.Its hard to explain you just have to live it.</p>
<br> Airport wise LAX(Los Angeles),SEA(Seattle/Taccoma),JFK(NYC),
EWR(Newark),PHL(Philadelphia),KWI(Kuwait),DXB(Dubai),AUH(Abu Dhabi),DEL(New Delhi) and last but not least my very own MAA(Chennai also known as Madras). I liked these airports because I don't know why but I just felt good energy.But in MAA when arriving there is so many people standing outside feeling as if you are a celebrity. My favorite flights are Emirates, Ethihad,jetBLue and Jet Airways.Flights that I want to go on either because I've never been on it or I was too young to remember the experience are Singapore Airlines,Malaysia Airlines,British Airways and Lufthansa.Traveling is amazing since there is always something to see or explore.</br>
