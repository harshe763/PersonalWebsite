	<br>	Math is my favorite subject.It is my favorite subject since I barely put any effort in it and it just comes easy to me.The only time I didn't like math was when doing geometry.In geometry there was proofs involved and doing that involved too much writing and I am not the biggest fan of english. And more of a numbers person. My confidence of my knowledge in math made me like it a lot and have a positive feeling about it just assuming it would be easy. One thing that had to make me know it was one of my teachers said math was everywhere in life and I agreed because it is true.And I was just good at it and no studying was needed. I used math for even the simplist things I was just so curious like what's KD's average points per game,what day of the week is 9/3/25. My parents also loved math and were good at it. My mom would tell me stories about a man named Srinivasa Ramanujan. A tamil mathematician who lived when the British ruled India.I believed that he was the greatest if not up there in the rankings.He was poor just like the rest up the people at the time and he self taught himself math.In 1918 Ramanujan became the first Indian mathematician to be elected a Fellow of the British Royal Society. With his information they could find details about black holes which would take us normal people forever but someone extroardinary like him just a little. He came up with many things never found before including something completely insane he predicted his own death using the power of maths that is when I realized how great math was and anything can be discovered using math.</br>
