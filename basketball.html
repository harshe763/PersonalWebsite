		Basketball is just so great. When I was younger my parents tried to introduce me to many sports but I for some reason was not interested. I then moved to a lovely place where many people played basketball it was like a paradise but I didn't realize it then. There I met my best friend and then we met a older kid who liked basketball and we started playing with him. Me and my best friend got destroyed and that is where I started loving basketball. I played basketball so much that my parents were even concerned about me because that could be very bad healthwise. I can say that I love basketball more than anyone and have a lot of respect for it as if it is like a god. That place was great the courts would be crowded all day you could never hear anything but the sound of the ball. I actually gained some publicity because I was there all day doing what I love. The truth is nothing stays the same in life everything is limited and you have to enjoy the moment when it is there and not worry about losing it later on. The unfortunate thing was me moving, now I barely get to see all the people that helped me get better, play in the great pickup games and many other special things that came with it. My old coach had plans with me to get my school 2 more championships but unfortunatey it wasn't possible. Also I know the doubt you have about how me a smaller and younger kid playing with older people, well I practiced my shot so much that it was straight money but on the defensive side I was bullied.</p>
        <br>That part was only the physical part. And a little piece of it.Now to the other part, I think you can call it the virtual part.My favorite team is the Miami Heat. I went from liking Lebron James to now Jimmy Butler this relates back to life doesn't always stay the same. I watched so much basketball and even learned about the history of the league and watched many videos related to basketball like one I remember is a man who went to play for a team in Libya which was owned by the leader of Libya. The leader of Libya was cruel and there was a rebellion where the player barely survived, forced to eat insects and it brought the idea that he almost lost his life for the sport. I watched many similar videos increasing my love for the game. So I pretty much became familiar with the history of the game. Also NBA video games were of my interestthe fist game I had was NBA2K13. And I loved doing the mode where you can play MyCareer as your favorite players. My dream proffession is being a proffessional basketball player because I believe anything is possible and to back it up people like Mark Eaton and Joel Embiid started playing ball very late and were still successful. So it is not an impossible task.
