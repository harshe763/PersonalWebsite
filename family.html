	<p><h2>Along with the other subjects one thing I also like is family. No matter who leaves you your family will always be there. My family originated in a place called Tamil Nadu in India. I was taught tamil very early by my parents. My family taught me many things like to be innocent, polite ignore bad people and so on. I like traveling and watching tamil movies with my parents because it is very fun. It is very tough to say much about my family but I can tell you I like family.</h2></p>
